# Emotion Detection using Deep Learning

This project implements an **Emotion Detection** system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built with TensorFlow and Keras. The model classifies facial expressions into various emotions like **happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral**, and more.

## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to classify emotions based on facial expressions in images. Emotion detection has various applications, such as in customer satisfaction analysis, human-computer interaction, and mental health assessments.

The system uses deep learning techniques to recognize and classify emotions in real-time from images or video frames. We use OpenCV for face detection and image preprocessing.

#caffemodel and prototxt
The caffemodel contains all these emotions 
- **Angry**
- **Disgust**
- **Fear**
- **Happy**
- **Sad**
- **Surprise**
- **Neutral**

The dataset contains 35,887 examples, each a 48x48 grayscale image.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model used for this project is designed to detect and classify emotions from facial expressions in images. The model follows this architecture:
- **Input**: 48x48 grayscale image
- **Convolutional Layers**: Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation to extract features.
- **MaxPooling Layers**: For downsampling.
- **Dropout Layer**: To reduce overfitting.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Dense layers to map features to emotion classes.
- **Output**: Softmax activation for emotion classification.
